When I ran some benchmarks, I saw something that made my heart skip a beat: $ tailfin run bench/bench.sh --build=main --default ... bfs: error: bench/corpus/chromium/v8/src/heap/heap.cc: Structure needs cleaning If you're not familiar, \\\"structure needs cleaning\\\" is the human-readable description of EUCLEAN , an errno value that usually indicates filesystem corruption. Fearing the worst, I checked dmesg and saw $ dmesg | tail ... BTRFS critical (device dm-2): corrupted node, root=518 block=16438782945911875046 owner mismatch, have 4517169229596899607 expect [256, 18446744073709551360] I immediately rebooted into a live environment and ran btrfs check , but to my surprise, there were no errors found. btrfs scrub also found no evidence of corruption. And in fact, the file from the error message was completely fine. Whatever the issue was, it seemed to have gone away on its own. I searched Google for that \\\"corrupted node\\\" message and found that it had happened to someone else recently too: Linus Torvalds , just after merging a Btrfs pull request. (This was not the first time Linus and I had hit the same bug. We both have the same CPU in our desktops. Last time it led to one of my favourite bugfixes ever .) But the difference between me and Linus was that I could (semi-)reliably reproduce the error. Not every time, but maybe 10% of the time I ran bfs with parallel stat() calls on a large directory tree, I would see that \\\"structure needs cleaning\\\" error. I reported my findings to the Btrfs mailing list, and though it led to some discussion about potential causes, we didn't narrow down the root cause. extent_buffer Based on the logs, the Btrfs developers assumed the problem had to do allocation of struct extent_buffer and their memory pages. I'm not a Btrfs internals expert by any means, but I understand that extent_buffer s are used for metadata I/O; that is, reading and writing B-tree nodes. An extent_buffer is associated with an array of struct folio / struct page (depending on kernel version), and those pages hold the actual contents of the extents that are read or written. The abstraction helps with file system block sizes that are different from the system page size. Allocating an extent_buffer and its pages is more complicated than you might expect . Each struct extent_buffer holds an array of struct folio , and those folios have a private reference that points back to the extent_buffer . There should only ever be one extent_buffer at a time for any particular extent. To reduce locking on the allocation path, the extent_buffer and the corresponding folios are allocated separately, linked together, and then inserted into a radix tree keyed by the start offset of the extent. Only the radix tree insertion needs locking. At the point of insertion, if it turns out someone else beat us to allocating the same extent, we instead take an extra reference to that extent_buffer and free the one we just allocated (and its pages). This code path had undergone some churn recently, both changing the race detection/handling strategy and converting from struct page to struct folio , so there was suspicion that a race or reference counting bug had crept in. But the extra debug logging didn't show it. It appeared that the extent_buffer and the folio s had all the right reference counts, but the memory itself had garbage rather than the appropriate on-disk contents. Btrfs does some sanity checks after reading these blocks in, and those checks were failing, causing the errors. But the on-disk blocks themselves were fine, and the next time we read them in, everything worked. git bisect bad One of the best bug hunting tools for the Linux kernel is git bisect . Unfortunately, bisecting bugs like this is challenging. For intermittent issues, it's easy enough to know when to mark a commit bad, but harder to know if a commit is good\\u2014maybe the bug just hasn't triggered yet . You also need a known-good commit to start from, but that was hard to find. I thought at first the bug was new in Linux 6.7, but I could still reproduce it on 6.6 and 6.5. The Btrfs devs suggested I start from 6.0. Bisecting can also be dangerous because you are running arbitrary old mid-development-cycle kernel commits that may have since had bugs fixed in the official releases. It's safer to do it from a virtual machine, but so far I had been unable to reproduce the bug on a VM. So started bisecting on my actual desktop. Normally I would be far too scared to bisect a filesystem corruption bug on my actual computer that I use daily. But this seemed like it wasn't \\\"real\\\" corruption, plus I have backups, so I risked it. Unfortunately, after a couple rounds, I ran into actual, on-disk filesystem corruption . 2,073,625 uncorrectable read errors is a new record for me, so I was too scared to continue the bisect. I restored what I could from backups and carried on with my life. tracefs A few weeks later, Btrfs developer Qu Wenruo got back to me with some extra debugging patches and I decided to give it another shot. I ran his patch on bare metal, but wasn't able to reproduce the bug with the debugging patch applied. Such is life when debugging race conditions! I also tried again to reproduce the issue in a VM. I configured it to more closely match my actual system configuration: multiple disks with dm-crypt full disk encryption, joined together in a Btrfs RAID 0 array. And I made them emulated NVME drives instead of VirtIO. That did the trick: I could now reproduce the issue in a VM, though it took around 30 runs of my reproducer instead of the ~10 it took in real life. But this time I could still reproduce it with the debugging patch applied. After a couple runs and tweaking the trace messages to make cross-referencing easier, I noticed something odd. Looking at just the lines from the trace corresponding to the \\\"corrupted\\\" error message, I saw this: $ grep 'eb=15302115328' dmesg.log BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupted leaf, root=258 block=15302115328 owner mismatch, have 13709377558419367261 expect [256, 18446744073709551360] eb=15302115328 iou-wrk--173727 15..... 2649295481us : alloc_extent_buffer: alloc_extent_buffer: alloc eb=15302115328 len=16384 kworker/-322 15..... 2649295735us : end_bbio_meta_read: read done, eb=15302115328 page_refs=3 eb level=0 fsid=b66a67f0-8273-4158-b7bf-988bb5683000 kworker/-5095 31..... 2649295941us : end_bbio_meta_read: read done, eb=15302115328 page_refs=8 eb level=0 fsid=b66a67f0-8273-4158-b7bf-988bb5683000 The only relevant operations seem to be allocating this extent_buffer , and then reading it ... twice. Reading it once ought to be enough, I thought, so I looked more closely at the code that actually reads them in and managed to eyeball the bug. read_extent_buffer_pages() Just like how multiple threads might try to allocate the same extent_buffer at the same time, they might also try to read it at the same time. To ensure the read only happens once, a custom locking protocol is used: int read_extent_buffer_pages(struct extent_buffer *eb, /* ... */) { if (test_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE, &eb->bflags)) return 0; /* ... */ /* Someone else is already reading the buffer, just wait for it. */ if (test_and_set_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &eb->bflags)) goto done; /* ... */ bbio = btrfs_bio_alloc(INLINE_EXTENT_BUFFER_PAGES, REQ_OP_READ | REQ_META, eb->fs_info, end_bbio_meta_read, eb); /* ... */ btrfs_submit_bio(bbio, mirror_num); done: if (wait == WAIT_COMPLETE) { wait_on_bit_io(&eb->bflags, EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE); if (!test_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE, &eb->bflags)) return -EIO; } return 0; } static void end_bbio_meta_read(struct btrfs_bio *bbio) { /* ... */ bool uptodate = !bbio->bio.bi_status; /* ... */ if (uptodate) { set_extent_buffer_uptodate(eb); } else { clear_extent_buffer_uptodate(eb); set_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READ_ERR, &eb->bflags); } /* ... */ clear_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &eb->bflags); smp_mb__after_atomic(); wake_up_bit(&eb->bflags, EXTENT_BUFFER_READING); /* ... */ } The logic is intended to work like this: read_extent_buffer_pages() { if (test_bit(UPTODATE)) return 0; if (test_and_set_bit(READING)) goto done; btrfs_submit_bio(); done: wait_on_bit_io(READING); return 0; } end_bbio_meta_read() { set_bit(UPTODATE); clear_bit(READING); wake_up_bit(READING); } read_extent_buffer_pages() { if (test_bit(UPTODATE)) return 0; if (test_and_set_bit(READING)) goto done; btrfs_submit_bio(); done: wait_on_bit_io(READING); return 0; } Unfortunately, this locking protocol has a bug: if (test(UPTODATE)) return 0; if (test_and_set(READING)) goto done; btrfs_submit_bio(); done: wait_on(READING); return 0; set(UPTODATE); clear(READING); wake_up(READING); if (test(UPTODATE)) return 0; if (test_and_set(READING)) goto done; btrfs_submit_bio(); done: wait_on(READING); return 0; if (test(UPTODATE)) return 0; if (test_and_set(READING)) goto done; btrfs_submit_bio(); done: wait_on(READING); return 0; If the first thread starts and finishes the I/O between the second thread checking the UPTODATE bit and the READING bit, the second thread will start a totally unnecessary read even though we already read in the extent. Worse, because the UPTODATE bit is already set, the third will return without waiting for the read to complete. That thread will then think it's safe to access the extent_buffer 's pages, despite them currently being under I/O, leading to a data race! The fix is to use double-checked locking : after setting the READING bit, check UPTODATE again so we don't kick off more useless (actively harmful, even) I/O. if (test(UPTODATE)) return 0; if (test_and_set(READING)) goto done; if (test(UPTODATE)) goto wake; btrfs_submit_bio(); done: wait_on(READING); return 0; end_bbio: set(UPTODATE); wake: clear(READING); wake_up(READING); if (test(UPTODATE)) return 0; if (test_and_set(READING)) goto done; if (test(UPTODATE)) goto wake; btrfs_submit_bio(); done: wait_on(READING); return 0; end_bbio: set(UPTODATE); wake: clear(READING); wake_up(READING); if (test(UPTODATE)) return 0; if (test_and_set(READING)) goto done; if (test(UPTODATE)) goto wake; btrfs_submit_bio(); done: wait_on(READING); return 0; end_bbio: set(UPTODATE); wake: clear(READING); wake_up(READING); I submitted a patch that adds this missing check, as well as a couple cleanup patches . With that fix, I can run the reproducer overnight without triggering any more errors. Epilogue You might be surprised that this race was not benign. After all, we're reading some disk blocks into memory that already holds the contents of those same disk blocks. It's still technically a data race to read and write memory at the same time, even if the writes don't modify the memory, but usually it would be unobservable in practice. uninitialized memory uninitialized memory uninitialized memory uninitialized memory uninitialized memory metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metad metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metad The reason I could observe it was already mentioned above: full disk encryption. When dm-crypt processes a disk read, it reads the encrypted contents into memory and then decrypts them in-place. uninitialized memory uninitialized memory uninitialized memory uninitialized memory uninitialized memory encrypted gibberish encrypted gibberish encrypted gibberish encrypted gibber encrypted gibberish encrypt metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metad encrypted gibberish encrypted gibberish encrypted gibberish encrypted gibber encrypted gibberish encrypt metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metad It's obvious why this causes problems: sometimes the racing thread will see valid metadata, but sometimes it will see encrypted bytes that appear totally random. I even captured a trace where the error messages show the extent being gradually filled in: [ 807.737576] BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupted node, root=266 block=3178470954007437077 owner mismatch, have 6155297726051334641 expect [256, 18446744073709551360] eb=ffff8ac915d022d0 start=12738904064 [ 807.751913] BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupted leaf, root=266 block=12738904064 owner mismatch, have 6155297726051334641 expect [256, 18446744073709551360] eb=ffff8ac915d022d0 start=12738904064 [ 807.800898] BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupted leaf, root=266 block=12738904064 owner mismatch, have 6155297726051334641 expect [256, 18446744073709551360] eb=ffff8ac915d022d0 start=12738904064 There you can see the same block switch from an internal node to a leaf, and the block number change from a random number to the start of the extent, over about 0.02 seconds.\",\n          \" that would have an impact on inflation\",\n          \"Use weird tests to capture tacit knowledge \\u00b7 Applied Cartography 2024-03-04 Use weird tests to capture tacit knowledge Working on Buttondown \\u2014 or any mature, complex codebase \\u2014 effectively and quickly requires a lot of tacit knowledge that I've done a hitherto-poor job of documenting, a fact I am learning more and more quickly as I start to scale up the number of folks working on the codebase. Documentation in the literal sense is a good first step and final step, of course, but when a codebase is in the \\\"process\\\" of being documented writing down \\\"this is how you do X\\\" does often not actually solve the problem of making sure everyone can do X safely and quickly. One thing that I've found useful, in the spirit of shifting process to the left, is capturing steps in tests. Here's a simple (but real!) example: adding new Django modules to the codebase. Whenever you run python manage.py startapp , you also need to add the new app to a bunch of different places: pytest.ini , so tests are run; pyproject.toml , so files are linted; modules.txt , so metrics are exported. The perfect solution to this problem is creating a script that automatically adds a new app to all the relevant places and stuffing it into a Justfile, but that's a pretty big piece of work that requires thought and error handling and a whole slew of other stuff. Instead, it's comparatively easy to just capture these constraints in a test: # This test suite ensures that, when we create or rename a module, # we update all the relevant configurations so that we lint/test/etc. that module. from django . conf import settings RELEVANT_FILES = [ \\\"./pyproject.toml\\\" , \\\"./pytest.ini\\\" , \\\"./modules.txt\\\" ] def pytest_generate_tests ( metafunc ) : parameters = [ ] for filename in RELEVANT_FILES : for module in settings . BUTTONDOWN_APPS : parameters . append ( ( module , filename ) ) metafunc . parametrize ( \\\"module,filename\\\" , parameters ) def test_module_is_present_in_pytest ( module : str , filename : str ) - > None : assert module in open ( filename ) . read ( ) This approach also works well when you're trying to enforce a norm or invariant for all new code. (At Stripe, we called this approach \\\"ratchet testing\\\", though initial Googling seems to indicate that this metaphor has not exactly spread like wildfire.) Another example: Buttondown uses Django-Ninja to generate an OpenAPI spec from the live API. OpenAPI is great, but it sadly lacks an ergonomic ability to document each value of an enum , so we maintain a separate enums.json file that needs to be updated whenever a relevant enum has a new addition \\u2014 even though some enum values are undocumented! A similar approach works well here: import json ENUMS_FILENAME = \\\"../shared/enums.json\\\" OPENAPI_SPEC_FILENAME = \\\"assets/autogen/openapi.json\\\" RAW_ENUMS = json . load ( open ( ENUMS_FILENAME ) ) RAW_OPENAPI_SPEC = json . load ( open ( OPENAPI_SPEC_FILENAME ) ) def pytest_generate_tests ( metafunc ) : parameters = [ ] enums = RAW_ENUMS . keys ( ) for enum_name in enums : extant_enum_values = RAW_OPENAPI_SPEC [ \\\"components\\\" ] [ \\\"schemas\\\" ] [ enum_name ] [ \\\"enum\\\" ] for enum_value in extant_enum_values : parameters . append ( ( enum_name , enum_value ) ) metafunc . parametrize ( \\\"enum_name,enum_value\\\" , parameters ) # Do not add more items to this ratchet unless you need to! KNOWN_MISSING_PAIRS = [ ( \\\"CreateSubscriberErrorCode\\\" , \\\"metadata_invalid\\\" ) , ( \\\"ExternalFeedAutomationCadence\\\" , \\\"daily\\\" ) , ( \\\"UpdateSubscriberErrorCode\\\" , \\\"email_already_exists\\\" ) , # ... and so on. ] # This technically does not exercise Python code; it's testing that `shared/enums.json` is up to date. def test_enum_is_exhaustively_documented ( enum_name : str , enum_value : str ) - > None : assert ( enum_name in RAW_ENUMS ) , f\\\"Enum { enum_name } is not documented in { ENUMS_FILENAME } \\\" if ( enum_name , enum_value ) in KNOWN_MISSING_PAIRS : return assert ( enum_value in RAW_ENUMS [ enum_name ] ) , f\\\"Potential value { enum_value } of enum { enum_name } is not documented in { ENUMS_FILENAME } \\\" What I find most lovely about this approach is that test-driven invariants are self-documenting. A task like \\\"adding a new value to an existing enum\\\" is not obviously a thing that should require searching an internal knowledge base, but a test that captures information about it can contain code pointers, technical explanation, and a way to fix it. In general, a good mental exercise whenever you're reviewing a PR is \\\"could a test have caught this?\\\", and then reminding yourself that a test should be defined less as \\\"a thing that exercises business logic\\\" and more as a \\\"script that exercises your codebase\\\".
